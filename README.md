![Location Permission Prompt](./screenshots/location-permission.png)

### Automatic Location Detection
After allowing localhost to access the user's location, the browser automatically detects the user's location and locates their device on the map with a 'You are here' prompt on a pin with the accurate location.

<!-- Add: automatic-location-screenshot.png -->
![Automatic Location Detection](./screenshots/automatic-location.png)

### Manual Location Input
The user's location can also be entered manually in the input textbox.

For instance, if 'Thaltej' is written in the textbox and the 'Set Location' button is clicked, the external geocoding API converts the location to the exact coordinates and locates the user on the map like it did for automatic location detection.

<!-- Add: manual-location-screenshot.png -->
![Manual Location Input](./screenshots/manual-location.png)

### Nearby Facilities
Simultaneously, it displays a comprehensive list of nearby facilities like hospitals, fire stations, etc around the user's location within a distance of user's choice in the range of 7 KMs.

![Nearby Facilities](./screenshots/nearby-facilities.png)

### Test Data - SheltR City
We have stored dummy data that is a fictional/made-up city called 'SheltR' for testing purposes.

When SheltR is entered in the textbox, the API translates the made up city into actual coordinates and shows made up facilities around those coordinates. In both automatic and manual location detection, a comprehensive list of facilities is shown with name, type, address, availability, and contact number.
