# SheltR-Disaster-Assistance-System
**SheltR** is a **Disaster Assistance System** that helps users find nearby safety facilities, view real-time weather and disaster updates, and access multilingual safety guidance during emergencies.

It bridges the gap between **authorities, responders, and the public**, ensuring that critical alerts and resources reach those who need them most.

By quickly delivering, the system empowers individuals seeking shelter or evacuating, helping to reduce harm and save lives.

By reducing communication delays and providing real-time updates, the system plays a vital role in saving lives, reducing damage, and maintaining order during life-threatening situations.

SheltR‚Äôs mission is to empower individuals and communities with immediate, accessible, and life-saving information during emergencies through innovative technology and real-time data integration.

## üíª Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ManwaniDiksha/SheltR-Disaster-Assistance-System.git
cd SheltR-Disaster-Assistance-System
```

### 2. Install Backend Dependencies
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder:
```env
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

### 4. Start the Application
```bash
npm start
```

### 5. Access the Application
Open your browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## üñ•Ô∏è User Interface Screens

### Landing Page
After running the server, the Landing Page is accessed with `http://localhost:3000/landingpage.html` and it has several buttons that lead to different modules.

![Landing Page](screenshots/landing-page.png)

### Immediate Assistance Module
The 'Get Immediate Assistance' button leads to its Module which is accessed through `http://localhost:3000/emergency.html`

![Emergency Module](screenshots/emergency-module.png)

![Location Permission Prompt](screenshots/location-permission.png)

### Location Detection
After clicking on the 'Detect My Location' button, the browser's geolocation API throws a prompt for location permission.

![Automatic Location Detection](screenshots/automatic-location.png)

### Automatic Location Detection
After allowing localhost to access the user's location, the browser automatically detects the user's location and locates their device on the map with a 'You are here' prompt on a pin with the accurate location.

![Automatic Location Detection](screenshots/automatic-location-detection.png)

### Manual Location Input
The user's location can also be entered manually in the input textbox.

![Manual Location Input](screenshots/type-thaltej.png)

For instance, if 'Thaltej' is written in the textbox and the 'Set Location' button is clicked, the external geocoding API converts the location to the exact coordinates and locates the user on the map like it did for automatic location detection.

![Manual Location Input](screenshots/manual-location.png)

### Nearby Facilities
Simultaneously, it displays a comprehensive list of nearby facilities like hospitals, fire stations, etc around the user's location within a distance of user's choice in the range of 7 KMs.

![Nearby Facilities](screenshots/nearby-facilities.png)

### Test Data - SheltR City
We have stored dummy data that is a fictional/made-up city called 'SheltR' for testing purposes.

![SheltR Test Data](screenshots/sheltR-test-data1.png)

When SheltR is entered in the textbox, the API translates the made up city into actual coordinates and shows made up facilities around those coordinates. In both automatic and manual location detection, a comprehensive list of facilities is shown with name, type, address, availability, and contact number.

![SheltR Test Data](screenshots/sheltR-test-data2.png)

### Homepage Navigation
Using the browser's navigation, the user goes back to the landing page to explore the website further.

![Landing Page](screenshots/landing-page-2.png)

When the user clicks on the 'HOME' button in the navigation bar of the website, it leads the user to the home page which is a menu for the main modules of the website. The 'Immediate Emergency Assistance' can also be accessed from the homepage.

![Homepage](screenshots/homepage.png)

### Weather Dashboard
On clicking the navigation arrow in the 'Live Weather Dashboard' section, it leads the user to the weather webpage. On the user's entry to the webpage, it automatically detects the location of the user and displays its weather information. It displays 'Current Weather' and '5-day Forecast'.

![Weather Dashboard](screenshots/weather-dashboard.png)

### Automatic Weather Location
This is how automatic location works upon the user's entry to the webpage. Another way for the user to submit their location automatically to the backend is the 'Detect My Location' button. When the user clicks on it, it automatically detects the user's location and displays the weather information.

![Automatic Weather Detection](screenshots/automatic-weather.png)

### Manual Weather Input
Location can also be entered manually in the input textbox. And the weather of that location can be viewed by clicking on the 'Get Weather' button. For instance, in the picture below, the user enters Mumbai in the textbox and clicks on the 'Get Weather' button to access the weather of Mumbai.

![Manual Weather Input](screenshots/manual-weather.png)

### Weather Details
The 'Current Weather' section displays the city name and country initials and weather factors like temperature, condition, humidity, and wind speed of that city. The '5-day Forecast' section displays the next 5 five days and dates with temperature, condition, and humidity in that city for each day.

![Weather Details](screenshots/weather-details.png)
